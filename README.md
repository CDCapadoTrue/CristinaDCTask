According to the task, I have tried to use Xcode simulator to test the Do not disturb mode, but this is a feature that does not appear at the simulator.
So I have created two tests,one is for the Do not disturb feature at settings, but this test is going to fails as is launching settings but it is never going to find the Do not disturb option.
One test is to check that do not disturb option is not set by default, the other one changes the status and set the do not distrub mode to on.

As I would like to create a test and see it executed, I have created another one, but this one,test inside settings and maps feature the Weather Conditions option, there are mostly the same tests but at least I could see them executed.

Please any issue let me know.

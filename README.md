According to the task, I have tried to use Xcode simulator to test the Do not disturb mode, but this is a feature that does not appear at the simulator.
So I have created two tests,one is for the Do not disturb feature at settings, but this test is going to fails as is launching settings but it is never going to find the Do not disturb option.
One test is to check that do not disturb option is not set by default, the other one changes the status and set the do not distrub mode to on.

As I would like to create a test and see it executed, I have created another UI Test class, but this one, tests inside settings and maps feature the *Weather Conditions* option, there are mostly the same tests but at least I could see them executed.

I had several issues with Mac in the cloud, I would like to do the same task but using cucumberish, but I couldnÂ´t finish that yesterday so I have preferred to send you the task only using xCT, if you are interested in see how would it be in cucumberish I could  do it also for another day.



Please any issue let me know.
